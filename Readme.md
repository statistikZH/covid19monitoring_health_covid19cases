Data is based on "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openZH/covid_19/master/COVID19_Fallzahlen_CH_total.csv". Cantonal cumulated time-series of covid-19 cases and deceased are completed by filling in missing values (especially on weekends) with last known value beforehand. Decumulation is then done, to get new cases/deceased on any given day per Canton. These time series are then aggregated to nuts-3 regions (Grossregionen BFS) for simplicity and statistical meaningfulness.
